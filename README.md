# MATLAB HS12 – Research Plan 


> * Group Name: (be creative!)
> * Group participants names: Arner Flurin, Demicheli Samuele, Schaer Alessandro, Solcà Gerson
> * Project Title: Mensa optimization by queue separation

## General Introduction

Every day it's the same old story:
The mensas are full, the queues keep growing and the wait seems to have no end.
Since we are directly interested, we asked ourselves if it's due to the mensa's configuration
and we thought of another approach;
"What if you had to choose the line before entering the mensa without having the possibility to change it?"
Other groups have already simulated a model of the actual mensa of the ETH, but we are interested on the effects of
a change in the mensa structure. 
(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) 
(Why is your model a good abstraction of the problem you want to study?) 
(Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)
